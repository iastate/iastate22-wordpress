# Blockquote

**This is a custom component (the class has been prefaced with `.iastate22-[classname]`).**

- In addition to the quote text, it supports an optional image and optional author fields, as well as the optional role field attached to the author if needed.
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/blockquote/blockquote";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--blockquote">`.
