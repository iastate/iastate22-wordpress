# Call To Action

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- There are two variations to this component (you'll notice a note in the "Default" version `(This variant of the component is empty for fractal purposes - please see --large and --small variants)`, this is simply because there isn't a "Default" version - one of the two variants must be used)
- The `--large` version contains an image, heading, text and button set
- The `--small` version contains a heading and button set
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/call-to-action/call-to-action";`
- There are paragraph-widget wrappers for these components for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--call-to-action--large">` and `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--call-to-action--small">`.
