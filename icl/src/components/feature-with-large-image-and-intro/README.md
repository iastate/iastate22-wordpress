# Feature with Large Image and Intro

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- Component contains heading and intro text, as well as the nested component `feature-with-large-image` (with some style variations)
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/feature-with-large-image-and-intro/feature-with-large-image-and-intro";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--callout-inset">`.
