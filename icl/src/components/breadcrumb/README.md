# Breadcrumb

**This is a custom component (the class has been prefaced with `.iastate22-[classname]`).**

- There are two variations for the breadcrumbs, the only difference between the two is the way they display on mobile. For the default version, the full path is listed out and for the `breadcrumb--top-level-pages` version, only the parent page link is shown on mobile. On desktop they are identical.
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/breadcrumb/breadcrumb";`
