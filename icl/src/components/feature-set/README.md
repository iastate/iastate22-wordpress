# Feature Set

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- This is a companion component associated with the `feature` component which outputs multiple instances with a background color included
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/feature-set/feature-set";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--callout-set">`.
