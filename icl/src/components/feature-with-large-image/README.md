# Feature With Large Image

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- Uses the `button-set` subcomponent
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/feature-with-large-image/feature-with-large-image";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--feature-with-large-image">`.
