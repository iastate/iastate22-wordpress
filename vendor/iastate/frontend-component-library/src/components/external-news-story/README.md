# External News Story

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- Intended for external links using the `link-set` sub-component with the "variant" field set to `iastate22-link-external`
- The `subhead` section is optional
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/external-news-story/external-news-story";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--external-news-story">`.
