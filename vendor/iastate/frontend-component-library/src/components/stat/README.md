# Stat

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- Contains room for the statistic title (the statistic itelf) and supporting text
- There is a companion component associated called `statistic` which outputs the statistic with room for text (and floats the statistic box left or right) - this should typically be used for output globally
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/stat/stat";`
