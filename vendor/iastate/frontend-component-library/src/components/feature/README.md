# Feature

**This is a custom component (the class has been prefaced with `.iastate22-[classname]`).**

- There is a companion component associated, called `feature-set` which outputs multiple instances with a background color included
- The image is optional, if none is added an additional class of `.iastate22-callout--no-image` is added to stretch the content to be full-width
- The component allows for multiple links to be added
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/feature/feature";`
