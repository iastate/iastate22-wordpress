# Link Block

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- The `title` field is optional
- Contains subcomponent `link-set` for as many links as are needed to be included
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/link-block/link-block";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--link-block">`.
