# Feature with Small Image

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- The component supports one button, plus an optional link set (the example does not show the link set, but the secondary links are recommended if multiple links are needed)
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/feature-with-small-image/feature-with-small-image";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--callout-with-image">`.
