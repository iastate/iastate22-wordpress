# Pagination

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap â€” there is a similar pagination class in bootstrap, but these styles will not conflict as this is scoped to the class of `.pagination-block`)**

- This pagination contains arrows to get to the start, previous page, page numbers, next page and final page of results being paginated through
- Buttons with the `disabled` attribute will be greyed out and not clickable
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/pagination/pagination";`
