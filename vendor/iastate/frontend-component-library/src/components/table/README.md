# Table

**This is a custom component (the class has been prefaced with `.iastate22-[classname]`).**

- The table is built to allow for horizontal scrolling on mobile, flush to the right edge of the device/screen
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/table/table";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--table">`.
