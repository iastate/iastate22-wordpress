# Site Footer

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- The site footer has sections for Primary, Secondary, Departments (with contact info) and Utility navigations
- The `site-footer--ecosystem` variant has some optional elements: Social Navigation, Primary Navigation, Secondary Navigation, Address, Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, and Utility Navigation. The Social Navigation has room for Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Flickr - each is optional. For the Secondary Navigation if there are less than 3 links - the "Quick Links" label will be removed.
- Uses font-awesome icons for the social media logos
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/site-footer/site-footer";`
