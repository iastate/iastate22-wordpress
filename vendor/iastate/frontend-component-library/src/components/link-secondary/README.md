# Link Secondary

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- For the arrow on the right side, the markup `<span class="arrow"></span>` is required after the button text
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/link-secondary/link-secondary";`
- Typically the button would be placed onto a page using the companion component `link-set`, which allows for multiple instances of the links to be output
