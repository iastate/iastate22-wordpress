# Full Width Image

**This is a custom component (no class prefix in place as it does not conflict with bootstrap)**

- Images within the `full-width-image__image` element will be inline `img` elements and are sized using the css `object-fit` property (a polyfill is included for older browsers)
- The custom styles are imported into the `index.scss` file as `@import "../components/full-width-image/full-width-image";`
- There is a paragraph-widget wrapper for use in page context `<div class="paragraph-widget paragraph-widget--full-width-image">`.
