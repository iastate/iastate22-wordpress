# Form

**This is not intended to be output as a component - used mainly to style individual form elements**

- Using custom `checkbox` and `radio` buttons
- Items should be wrapped with `<div class="form-item"></div>`
- This is using the markup of `<button type="submit">Submit<span class="arrow"></span></button>` as the form submit input to achieve our standard button style
