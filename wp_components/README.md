# Iowa State University Front End Library

This holds any wordpress specific CSS, that is not in the Iowa State Frontend Library.


## Dependencies

Dependencies need to be installed with [node/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), and is best pinned to stable versions via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). More on [node usage at idfive](https://developers.idfive.com/#/front-end/node).

- `cd wp_components`
- `nvm use`
- `npm install`

## Building for production

To build your code for production, run the following:

- `npm run build`


## Compiling CSS/JS

All CSS/JS/Images will be compiled from `src/*`.

### CSS

- All CSS to be written as SCSS, and compiled via Webpack.
- All CSS compiled from `src/scss/index.scss`

#### Utility Classes

- In `_base.scss`, `.align-left`, `.align-right`, and `.align-center` handle images placed in WYSIWYG sections
- In `_base.scss`, the `.skip-link` class is for the "Skip To Main Content" button for accessibility
- In `_placeholder-selectors.scss`, `.visible-for-screen-readers` is used to hide content but allow it to be accessibly read/spoken
- In `_placeholder-selectors.scss`, `.outer-pad-x` handles horiztonal padding throughout various parts of the site
- In `_placeholder-selectors.scss`, `%responsive-img` is a placeholder selector which sets up object-fit for images and the padding-top percentage for the associated pseudo element which sets the height of the image
- In `_placeholder-selectors.scss`, `.caption` is a re-used type style for image and video captions
- In `_placeholder-selectors.scss`, `.arrow` is the arrow shape used throughout various button and nav styles
- In `_base.scss`, there are two helper classes for remove the space above and below paragraph widgets. `.paragraph-widget-no-margin-bottom` will reduce the `margin-bottom` of the widget to zero and `.paragraph-widget-no-margin-top` will reduce the `margin-top` top zero. These both have `!important` tags attached to ensure there are no conflicts.

### JS

- All theme JS is written as TypeScript, and compiled to stable, browser-compliant JS via Webpack.
- ALL JS to be compiled from Typescript in `src/js/index.ts`

## Acceptance Standards

- [W3C Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Passes Accessibility check using WAVE and Google Lighthouse
- Provides fallback of full content for non-JS users.

## Page Wrapper and Overall Structure

This structure below shows the overall wrappers and ordering needed to properly display the layout:

```
<body>
  <a class="skip-link" href="#main-content">Skip To Main Content</a>
  <div class="off-canvas">
    <div class="max-bound">
      {% include "@site-header" with header %}
      <main id="main-content">
        {{ yield }}
      </main>
      {% include "@site-footer" with footer %}
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Scripts -->
</body>
```

- The `.skip-link` link is provided for accessibility purposes
- The `.off-canvas` div is in use to set `overflow-x: hidden;` on the whole page to prevent unwanted horizontal scrolling
- Next is the `.max-bound` div, which provides a max-width, (and 100% width), centers the content and provides a background-color the the whole document
- Next our main site header is added `{% include "@site-header" with header %}`
- Then the `<main id="main-content">` is added which contains all of the page content `{{ yield }}`
- After the closing `<main>` tag, the footer is added `{% include "@site-footer" with footer %}`
- Kitchen sink pages have an additional tag `<div class="outer-pad">` directly after `<main>`, which provides left and right padding for the page
